This documentation describes the Redis Enterprise (RE) Tile Manager for Pivotal Platform.
The RE Tile Manager allows Pivotal Platform users to deploy multiple RE tiles on a single foundation.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Redis Enterprise (RE) Tile Manager allows Pivotal Platform users to deploy multiple Redis Enterprise for Pivotal Platform tiles on a single foundation.
Because each RE tile manages a single RE cluster, RE Tile Manager enables the deployment and independent management of multiple
RE clusters, allowing for:

* Database isolation - For use cases that cannot use multi-tenancy of databases
  on a single cluster and require complete database isolation
* Independent cluster administration - For organizations that require independent administration
  of individual clusters by separate IT or DevOps teams
* Dedicated infrastructure - For running and managing independent Redis Enterprise Clusters on unique and separate resources to serve specific use-cases

## <a id="features"></a>Key Features

Redis Enterprise Tile Manager for Pivotal Platform includes these key features:

* Deploy one or more Redis Enterprise for Pivotal Platform tile deployments through a Web UI
* Visibility into the currently installed RE tiles, their names, and their port assignment
* Ability to assign TCP port ranges to each tile without IP overlap
* Ability to centrally stage upgrades of individual clusters to the latest Redis Enterprise Cluster release
